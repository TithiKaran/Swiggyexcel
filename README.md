Welcome to My SwiggyExcel Insights Project, an exciting data analysis project I have designed to uncover valuable insights into the world of food delivery using the Swiggy dataset from Kaggle. In this project, we delve into the rich data provided by Swiggy, utilizing 
advanced Excel analytics to extract meaningful trends and patterns and culminating in the creation of an interactive dashboard that 
serves as a dynamic window into the world of culinary trends and user behaviors. 
## Project Methodologies:
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In this phase, we focused on ensuring the dataset's integrity and reliability. Several data cleaning techniques were applied to address inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. In this Excel based project the first step is Data cleaning, First you have to check Data cleaning is required or not in your Dataset. In my case The cleaning was not required.If its required then this methods involved :
#### 1. Handling missing Data:   
Identified and addressed missing values in crucial fields, ensuring completeness.
Utilized Excel functions and filters to systematically handle and replace missing data points. 
#### 2. Outlier Detection and Removal:
Employed Excel's sorting and filtering capabilities to identify and address outliers.
Implemented conditional formatting and visual inspections to spot and manage data anomalies.
#### 3. Consistency Checks:
Ensured consistency in data formats, units, and naming conventions.
Leveraged Excel functions for string manipulations and standardizations.
### Pivot Table Analysis:
The pivot table functionality in Excel served as a powerful tool for aggregating and summarizing data, providing key insights into various aspects of the Swiggy dataset:
#### 1.Pivot Table Creation:
Utilized Excel's PivotTable feature to create dynamic and interactive summaries of the dataset.
Organized fields to analyze order trends, user behaviors, and restaurant performance.
#### 2.Data Aggregation:
Applied pivot table functions to aggregate data based on key dimensions such as cuisine, time, location, and user demographics.
Calculated metrics like total restaurants, average rating, average price and  maximum delivery times.
#### 3.Dynamic Filtering and Slicing:
Implemented dynamic filters and slicers to allow for interactive exploration of the data.
Enabled users to tailor the analysis based on specific criteria and timeframes.
### Pivot Chart Visualizations:
In this project, we harnessed the power of pivot charts within Excel to dynamically visualize trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from the Swiggy dataset:
#### 1.Chart Types:
Employed various chart types, including bar charts, line charts to represent different dimensions of the data.
Utilized bar charts for comparing Total restaurants for each city,comparing maximum and average delivery time, line charts for 
top rated restaurant analysis over average ratings.
#### 2. Chart Customization:
To ensure that the visualizations effectively communicate insights, we applied various customization techniques to the pivot 
charts.
